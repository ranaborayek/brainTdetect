First we applied median filter on the original image using two libraries (cv and scikit-image)
median filter (cv)

median filter (scikit-image)

and then gaussian high pass filter
median filter (cv)

median filter (scikit-image)

added the original image to the result
median filter (cv)

median filter (scikit-image)

thresholding
median filter (cv)

median filter (scikit-image)

watershed segmentation

erosion
